How Kaylee Was Born
-------------------

I first met Python in 2008. What a magnicifient time it was! Python felt
as a breath of fresh air. But long before that I started participating in
volunteer computing. Although `Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence <SETI>`_
seemed a bit science-fictional, thousands of PC owners donated their
computers' resources to analyze the signals from out of the Space.
Unfortunately the `BOINC`_ platform, on which `SETI@home` is built, requires
a special software which a user has to download, install and keep up running.

But what if you don't want or not allowed to install the required software?
What if your platform is not supported, like if you had a smartphone with
more performance than a 5-year old laptop?
Wouldn't it be wonderful if one could open a page in a browser and a second later
a volunteer computing process would start? Moreover, wouldn't it be
great if the browser was looking for the HIV or cancer cure in background,
while you've been reading your favourite news website?

With those ideas in mind I started developing a Python/JavaScript framework
but... seems it was too early for me in 2008, as I had just started learning
Python and was not experienced in writing *good* code at all.

Four years passed and I have returned to the idea of browser-based volunteer
computing. Let me describe the situation, as it is in year 2012:

* PCs are still alive but people prefer laptops to the old-fashioned towers.
* Dual-core processors in top-line smartphones is a usual thing and
  everything moves towards quad-core gadgets.
* Tablets are very popular and their performance is somewhere between
  laptops and smartphones.

As to technologies:

* HTML5 standard is getting more and more support in the major browsers
  both on desktop and mobile platforms.
* The standard includes so-called Web Workers which allow executing the
  code in a separate thread, without interfering with the browsers' main
  javascript event loop.

Seems like a right time to give a life to the ideas described above, isn't it?

Why *"Kaylee"*? If you have ever watched the "`Serenity`_" series, you would
figure the answer right away. The beautiful *Kaywinnet Lee "Kaylee" Frye*
portrayed by Jewel Staite is a genius mechanic who keeps the ship running no
matter how hard the situation is. Given the time she can deal with any problem
that occurs with any device on *Serenity*.

I hope that the ``Kaylee framework`` will be able to maintain all kind of
distributed/volunteer computing projects with the same elegance as
*Kaylee* maintains the *Serenity*.


Where should you go from here? I suggest continuing with :ref:`installation` or
:ref:`basics`.
