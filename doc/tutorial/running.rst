Step X: Compiling and Running the Application
=============================================

If everything was configured properly, you should be able to run the 
MonteCarloPi application the same way as the demo:
run `python src/bin/run.py` from the package and open
the browser with the corresponding address and port (e.g. the default
address of Flask is http://127.0.0.1:5000).
