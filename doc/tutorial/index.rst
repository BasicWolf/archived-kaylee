Tutorial
========
The easiest way to start with Kaylee is to dive into a simple distributed
computing application. In this tutorial we are going to write an application
which computes the value of PI via the **Monte Carlo method**.
Before we start with the new application please make sure that you're able to
run Kaylee :ref:`demo` which will guarantee that you will be able to run
the tutorial application.
