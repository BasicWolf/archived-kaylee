Kaylee
======

Kaylee is distributed and volunteer in-browser computing framework.
It is written in Python and CoffeeScript.


Is it ready yet?
================

**No!** Absolutely not. The Kaylee promise is that each tagged version 
is self-contained and working fine, but the API is not stable yet and 
there might be dramatic changes in future.


Where are the docs?
===================

Right here, in ``/doc``, or at http://kaylee.znasibov.info/docs

I need help!
