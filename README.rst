It is written in Python and CoffeeScript.


Is it ready yet?
================

Yes, as long as you stick to the provided API. Kaylee is currently
in early development, but we're looking forward to stick with the
API, especially the *Projects* part of it.


Where are the docs?
===================

Right here, in ``/doc``, or at http://kaylee.znasibov.info/docs

I need help!
